# JSON_api
Parsed iTunes search JSON api.
Implemented in Swift.
Simple example project that creates a Table View and a puts some JSON API results from iTunes inside of them. 
Currently displaying results of "Norah Jones" from iTunes. You can programmatically change if you need to search for another artist.
We also make a second API call to retrieve a list of tracks for an album, download higher resolution album art, and allows of to play previews of the tracks within the app.
